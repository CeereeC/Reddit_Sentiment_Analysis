We have a great community of obsessed Tellionaires that know everything possible about Tellurian.', 'Natural gas exports, specifically $TELL.\n\nAs you may have noticed, natural gas prices are extremely high in the US and abroad. The United States has a tremendous amount of oil reserves in shale. Accessing the oil creates an abundance of gas, however the investment cost of drilling and fracking requires a particular price level to justify investment. This creates cyclical commodities prices as the owners of the frackable land decide to drill or not drill based on prices and well viability. Because of this, like all commodities, the domestic market for energy is very competitive. The competition drives out margin forcing consolidation to enable economies of scale for the largest producers. \n\nHere is where $TELL comes in; Charif Souki who founded Cheniere (largest exporter of US LNG out of Sabine pass TX) is looking to expand US gas exports by partnering with one of these groups with a large shale play in the Haynesville and exporting the gas on the global markets. Because there is a global shortage of energy and renewables are expensive, not viable everywhere and very low market share currently, the best way to increase access to energy globally and stabilize the demand for the abundant US gas is to export it (the same concept why the USA and France are fighting over arms export deals… the exporting country gains economies of scale in stabilizing domestic markets which in gas are cyclical for reasons discussed above!).\n\nHigh gas prices in the US will give Tellurian the runway they need selling gas domestically to generate cash flows for acquiring land and M&A activity. Once they have enough upstream gas reserves secured through a combination of their own wells and acquisition, they already have lined up the 10 years contracts (Billions $$ of forwards revenue) with Shell, Gunvor and Vitol. They will finance the construction of the export terminal with a bank loan while credit is cheap, declare FID in Q1 2022 and begin construction. They have already signed a 20 year lease on the site land and have begun widening roads and pre construction activities. \n\nThere are major catalysts coming in the next few months (upstream acquisition, M&A, financing and FID) that will make this stock 3x in the short term, then stable growth over the 5 year construction window looking at a final price >$40 once they are actually exporting gas in 2026/7. You can look at $LNG (Cheniere) for some historical comparisons of how these kind of projects explode after FID and grow as they are exporting gas. \n\nThis is over 80% of my current portfolio and it will be my vehicle for building generational wealth for my children.'], 'PLTR': ['SoFi, PLTR and COST', "Both of these are 10% of my portfolio.\n\n\nMedium term?
